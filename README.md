Welcome to my Passion Project.

Shift Calendar is an Android app that helps you keep good track of your fitness, and occasionally gives you
somewhat functional reminders to get moving.

### Want to help?

To create this project, I didn't just need to learn `Java`. I also had to use:

*   `XML`
*   `Markdown` (this file that you're reading right now is written in this scripting language,
    which offers functionality similar to that of `HTML`)
*   `Gradle` (a build tool that allows you to package runtime dependencies along with your
    compiled Java bytecode into something called a "build")


### How does the code behind the app work?

See this presentation (not a rickroll or meme):
[https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1yLl1NQ-emm7VSoepsUGA4ing5n9zBxHKVGbFu95t3Qg/edit?usp=sharing](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1yLl1NQ-emm7VSoepsUGA4ing5n9zBxHKVGbFu95t3Qg/edit?usp=sharing)

- AdoptOpenJDK (1.8, Hotspot VM)

*    I (William Zhang) am not responsible for any damages to devices if you download the APK from the releases tab. Up to this point, I have not tested the code,
     and cannot give any guarantees about the safety and quality of my code until I learn ~~to stop complaining about the incessant bugs in my code~~ to use JUnit or JBoss
     for testing.
